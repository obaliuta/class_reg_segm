About this file
RowNumber—corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
CustomerId—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
Surname—the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
CreditScore—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
Geography—a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
Gender—it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
Age—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
Tenure—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
Balance—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
NumOfProducts—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
HasCrCard—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
IsActiveMember—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
EstimatedSalary—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
Exited—whether or not the customer left the bank.

Assignment
Your notebooks must contain the following steps:

Perform data cleaning and pre-processing.
What steps did you use in this process and how did you clean your data.
Perform exploratory data analysis on the given dataset.
Explain each and every graphs that you make.
Train a ml-model and evaluate it using different metrics.
Why did you choose that particular model? What was the accuracy?
Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection is a plus.
Model deployment and use of ml-flow is a plus.
Perform model interpretation and show feature importance for your model.
Provide some explanation for the above point.
Future steps. Note: try to have your notebooks as presentable as possible.

# customer segmentation

Link on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/customer-segmentation-dataset

Description:
A company that sells some of the product, and you want to know how well does the selling performance of the product. You have the data that can we analyze, but what kind of analysis that we can do? Well, we can segment customers based on their buying behavior on the market.
Keep in mind that the data is really huge, and we can not analyze it using our bare eyes. We will use machine learning algorithms and the power of computing for it.

This project will show you how to cluster customers on segments based on their behavior using the K-Means algorithm in Python.
I hope that this project will help you on how to do customer segmentation step-by-step from preparing the data to cluster it.

Objective:
Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
Build a clustering model to segment the customer-based similarity.
Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
